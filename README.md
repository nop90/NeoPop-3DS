NeoPop-3DS
==========

Nintendo 3DS port of the NeoPop emulator, based on NeoPop-SDL

To compile, you'll need to devkitARM:
	http://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started/devkitARM

To run, you'll need a 3DS that can run homebrew or use an emulator:
	https://github.com/citra-emu/citra

The project is a work in progress. Currently missing are things like a ROM selection GUI (rom is hardcoded in source/system_main.c), sound support, save states, etc.
