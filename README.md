NeoPop-3DS
==========

Nintendo 3DS port of the NeoPop emulator, based on NeoPop-SDL

## Setup

To compile, you'll need to devkitARM:
    http://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started/devkitARM

To run, you'll need a 3DS that can run homebrew or use an emulator:
    https://github.com/citra-emu/citra

**Controls**

* A: B
* B: A
* Option: Start
* Joy Stick: Both Analaog Stick and D-Pad
* X to exit

Roms (unzipped) go in a folder called "neogeo" in the root of your SD card.

The project is a work in progress. Currently missing are things like a proper ROM selection GUI, sound, save states, etc.
