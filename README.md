NeoPop-3DS
==========

Nintendo 3DS port of the NeoPop emulator, based on NeoPop-SDL

To compile, you'll need to devkitARM:
	http://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started/devkitARM

To run, you'll need a 3DS that can run homebrew or use an emulator:
	https://github.com/citra-emu/citra

The project is a work in progress. Currently missing are things like a proper ROM selection GUI, sound, save states, etc. Roms go in a folder called "neogeo" in the root of your SD card.
